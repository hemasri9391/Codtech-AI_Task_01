Technologies that can make a coherent summary take into account variables such as length, writing style and syntax.\n\nAutomatic data summarization is part of the real machine learning and data mining. The main idea of summarization is to find a subset of data which contains the \"information\" of the entire set. Such techniques are widely used in industry today. Search engines are an example; others include summarization of documents, image collections and videos. Document summarization tries to create a representative summary or abstract of the entire document, by finding the most informative sentences, while in image summarization the system finds the most representative and important (i.e. salient) images. For surveillance videos, one might want to extract the important events from the uneventful context.\n\nThere are two general approaches to automatic summarization: Extraction and Abstraction. \n1. *Extractive Summarization*: These methods rely on extracting several parts, such as phrases and sentences, from a piece of text and stack them together to create a summary. Therefore, identifying the right sentences for summarization is of utmost importance in an extractive method.\n2. *Abstractive Summarization*: These methods use advanced NLP techniques to generate an entirely new summary. Some parts of this summary may not even appear in the original text. Such a summary might include verbal innovations. \nResearch to date has focused primarily on extractive methods, which are appropriate for image collection summarization and video summarization.\n\nIn this Jupyter notebook, TextRank algorithm for extractive text summarization is implemented using Google's PageRank search algorithm to generate corelations among sentences.\n\n### Libraries Used\n- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org)\n- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\n- [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/)\n\n### Algorithms and Concepts\n- TextRank\n- [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank)\n- [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import nltk\nimport re\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\nimport networkx as nx","metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"GloVe word embeddings are vector representation of words.
